                    <p style="margin: 60px;">The College Dropout is the debut studio album by American rapper and
                        producer Kanye West. It was
                        released on February 10, 2004, by Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella Records. In the years
                        leading up to release, West had received praise for his production work for rappers such as
                        Jay-Z and Talib Kweli, but faced difficulty being accepted as an artist in his own right by
                        figures in the music industry. Intent on pursuing a solo career, he signed a record deal with
                        Roc-A-Fella and recorded the album over a period of four years, beginning in 1999.

                        The production of The College Dropout was primarily handled by West and developed his "chipmunk
                        soul" production style, which made use of sped-up, pitch shifted vocal samples from soul and R&B
                        records, in addition to West's own drum programming, string accompaniments, and gospel choirs;
                        the album also features contributions from Jay-Z, Mos Def, Jamie Foxx, Syleena Johnson, and
                        Ludacris, among others. Diverging from the then-dominant gangster persona in hip hop, West's
                        lyrics concern themes of family, self-consciousness, materialism, religion, racism, and higher
                        education.

                    <p style="margin: 75px;">Late Registration is the second studio album by American rapper and
                        producer Kanye West. It was
                        released on August 30, 2005, through Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella Records. The album was
                        recorded for over a year in sessions held across studios in New York City and Hollywood, with
                        West collaborating with American record producer and composer Jon Brion. It features guest
                        contributions from Adam Levine, Lupe Fiasco, Jamie Foxx, Common, The Game, Jay-Z, Brandy, and
                        Nas, among others.

                        The production of Late Registration was notably more lush and elaborate than West's 2004 debut
                        studio album The College Dropout, as he utilized intricate sampling methods and string
                        orchestration with Brion while drawing on stylistic influences from alternative acts such as
                        Portishead, Coldplay, and Fiona Apple. West's lyrics explore both personal and broader political
                        themes, including poverty, drug trafficking, racism, healthcare, and the blood diamond trade.

                        West, released on
                        September 11, 2007, through Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella Records. Recording sessions took
                        place between 2005 and 2007 at several studios in New York and Los Angeles. It was primarily
                        produced by West himself, with contributions from various other producers. The album also
                        features guest appearances from recording artists such as Dwele, T-Pain, Lil Wayne, DJ Premier,
                        and Chris Martin of Coldplay. The cover art and its interior artwork were designed by Japanese
                        contemporary artist Takashi Murakami.

                        Inspired by stadium tours, house-music and indie rock, Graduation marked a departure from the
                        ornate, soul-based sound of West's previous releases as he musically progressed to more anthemic
                        compositions. West incorporated layered synthesizers and dabbled with electronics while sampling
                        from various music genres and altering his approach to rapping. He conveys an ambivalent outlook
                        on his newfound fame and media scrutiny alongside providing inspirational messages of triumph
                        directed at listeners. The album concludes the education theme of West's first two studio
                        albums, The College Dropout (2004) and Late Registration (2005).

                        vocalist Kanye West. It was released on November 24, 2008, by Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella
                        Records. West recorded the album during September and October 2008 at Glenwood Studios in
                        Burbank, California and Avex Recording Studio in Honolulu, Hawaii, with the help of producers No
                        I.D., Jeff Bhasker and others. Guest appearances are featured from Kid Cudi, Young Jeezy, Mr
                        Hudson, and Lil Wayne.

                        Conceived in the wake of several distressing personal events, 808s & Heartbreak marked a major
                        musical departure from West's previous rap records, instead featuring a sparse, electronic sound
                        and West singing through an Auto-Tune vocal processor. His lyrics explore themes of loss,
                        alienated fame, and heartache, while the album's production abandons conventional hip hop sounds
                        in favor of a minimalist sonic palette, with prominent use of the Roland TR-808 drum machine.

                        rapper and producer Kanye West. It was released on November 22, 2010, by Def Jam Recordings and
                        Roc-A-Fella Records. It follows a period of public and legal controversy for West, who retreated
                        to a self-imposed exile in Hawaii in 2009 and recorded at Honolulu's Avex Recording Studio in a
                        communal environment involving numerous contributing musicians and producers. Additional
                        recording sessions took place at Glenwood Place Studios in Burbank, California, and at Electric
                        Lady Studios and Platinum Sound Recording Studios in New York City.

                        The album was produced primarily by West, along with a variety of high-profile producers such as
                        Mike Dean, No I.D., Jeff Bhasker, RZA, S1, Bink, and DJ Frank E. Music journalists have noted
                        the album features a maximalist aesthetic and opulent production quality with elements of West's
                        previous works, including soul, baroque, electro, and symphonic styles, as well as progressive
                        rock influences. Thematically, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy explores West's status as a
                        celebrity, consumer culture, race, and the idealism of the American Dream. Guest vocalists on
                        the album include Nicki Minaj, Rihanna, Bon Iver, Jay-Z, Pusha T, Rick Ross, Kid Cudi, John
                        Legend, Elton John and Raekwon.

                        West. It was released on June 18, 2013, through Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella Records. West
                        gathered a number of artists and close collaborators for the production, including Mike Dean,
                        Daft Punk, Noah Goldstein, Arca, Hudson Mohawke, and Travis Scott. The album also features guest
                        vocals from Justin Vernon, Chief Keef, Kid Cudi, Assassin, King L, Charlie Wilson, and Frank
                        Ocean.

                        Fifteen days before its release date, West enlisted the help of producer Rick Rubin to strip
                        down the sound of Yeezus in favor of a more minimalist approach. The album has been
                        characterized as West's most experimental and sonically abrasive work. It draws from an array of
                        genres, including industrial, acid house, electro, punk, and Chicago drill. West's
                        unconventional use of samples is also contained, as on "Blood on the Leaves", which contains a
                        sample from Nina Simone's 1965 rendition of "Strange Fruit".
