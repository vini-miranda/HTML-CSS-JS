                        <p style="margin: 60px;">The College Dropout is the debut studio album by American rapper and
                            producer Kanye West. It was
                            released on February 10, 2004, by Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella Records. In the years
                            leading up to release, West had received praise for his production work for rappers such as
                            Jay-Z and Talib Kweli, but faced difficulty being accepted as an artist in his own right by
                            figures in the music industry. Intent on pursuing a solo career, he signed a record deal with
                            Roc-A-Fella and recorded the album over a period of four years, beginning in 1999.
    
                            The production of The College Dropout was primarily handled by West and developed his "chipmunk
                            soul" production style, which made use of sped-up, pitch shifted vocal samples from soul and R&B
                            records, in addition to West's own drum programming, string accompaniments, and gospel choirs;
                            the album also features contributions from Jay-Z, Mos Def, Jamie Foxx, Syleena Johnson, and
                            Ludacris, among others. Diverging from the then-dominant gangster persona in hip hop, West's
                            lyrics concern themes of family, self-consciousness, materialism, religion, racism, and higher
                            education.

                        <p style="margin: 75px;">Late Registration is the second studio album by American rapper and
                            producer Kanye West. It was
                            released on August 30, 2005, through Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella Records. The album was
                            recorded for over a year in sessions held across studios in New York City and Hollywood, with
                            West collaborating with American record producer and composer Jon Brion. It features guest
                            contributions from Adam Levine, Lupe Fiasco, Jamie Foxx, Common, The Game, Jay-Z, Brandy, and
                            Nas, among others.
    
                            The production of Late Registration was notably more lush and elaborate than West's 2004 debut
                            studio album The College Dropout, as he utilized intricate sampling methods and string
                            orchestration with Brion while drawing on stylistic influences from alternative acts such as
                            Portishead, Coldplay, and Fiona Apple. West's lyrics explore both personal and broader political
                            themes, including poverty, drug trafficking, racism, healthcare, and the blood diamond trade.

                            West, released on
                            September 11, 2007, through Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella Records. Recording sessions took
                            place between 2005 and 2007 at several studios in New York and Los Angeles. It was primarily
                            produced by West himself, with contributions from various other producers. The album also
                            features guest appearances from recording artists such as Dwele, T-Pain, Lil Wayne, DJ Premier,
                            and Chris Martin of Coldplay. The cover art and its interior artwork were designed by Japanese
                            contemporary artist Takashi Murakami.
    
                            Inspired by stadium tours, house-music and indie rock, Graduation marked a departure from the
                            ornate, soul-based sound of West's previous releases as he musically progressed to more anthemic
                            compositions. West incorporated layered synthesizers and dabbled with electronics while sampling
                            from various music genres and altering his approach to rapping. He conveys an ambivalent outlook
                            on his newfound fame and media scrutiny alongside providing inspirational messages of triumph
                            directed at listeners. The album concludes the education theme of West's first two studio
                            albums, The College Dropout (2004) and Late Registration (2005).

                            vocalist Kanye West. It was released on November 24, 2008, by Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella
                            Records. West recorded the album during September and October 2008 at Glenwood Studios in
                            Burbank, California and Avex Recording Studio in Honolulu, Hawaii, with the help of producers No
                            I.D., Jeff Bhasker and others. Guest appearances are featured from Kid Cudi, Young Jeezy, Mr
                            Hudson, and Lil Wayne.
    
                            Conceived in the wake of several distressing personal events, 808s & Heartbreak marked a major
                            musical departure from West's previous rap records, instead featuring a sparse, electronic sound
                            and West singing through an Auto-Tune vocal processor. His lyrics explore themes of loss,
                            alienated fame, and heartache, while the album's production abandons conventional hip hop sounds
                            in favor of a minimalist sonic palette, with prominent use of the Roland TR-808 drum machine.

                        <p style="margin: 45px;">My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is the fifth studio album by American
                            rapper and producer Kanye West. It was released on November 22, 2010, by Def Jam Recordings and
                            Roc-A-Fella Records. It follows a period of public and legal controversy for West, who retreated
                            to a self-imposed exile in Hawaii in 2009 and recorded at Honolulu's Avex Recording Studio in a
                            communal environment involving numerous contributing musicians and producers. Additional
                            recording sessions took place at Glenwood Place Studios in Burbank, California, and at Electric
                            Lady Studios and Platinum Sound Recording Studios in New York City.
    
                            The album was produced primarily by West, along with a variety of high-profile producers such as
                            Mike Dean, No I.D., Jeff Bhasker, RZA, S1, Bink, and DJ Frank E. Music journalists have noted
                            the album features a maximalist aesthetic and opulent production quality with elements of West's
                            previous works, including soul, baroque, electro, and symphonic styles, as well as progressive
                            rock influences. Thematically, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy explores West's status as a
                            celebrity, consumer culture, race, and the idealism of the American Dream. Guest vocalists on
                            the album include Nicki Minaj, Rihanna, Bon Iver, Jay-Z, Pusha T, Rick Ross, Kid Cudi, John
                            Legend, Elton John and Raekwon.

                        <p style="margin: 72px;">Yeezus is the sixth studio album by American rapper and producer Kanye
                            West. It was released on June 18, 2013, through Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella Records. West
                            gathered a number of artists and close collaborators for the production, including Mike Dean,
                            Daft Punk, Noah Goldstein, Arca, Hudson Mohawke, and Travis Scott. The album also features guest
                            vocals from Justin Vernon, Chief Keef, Kid Cudi, Assassin, King L, Charlie Wilson, and Frank
                            Ocean.
    
                            Fifteen days before its release date, West enlisted the help of producer Rick Rubin to strip
                            down the sound of Yeezus in favor of a more minimalist approach. The album has been
                            characterized as West's most experimental and sonically abrasive work. It draws from an array of
                            genres, including industrial, acid house, electro, punk, and Chicago drill. West's
                            unconventional use of samples is also contained, as on "Blood on the Leaves", which contains a
                            sample from Nina Simone's 1965 rendition of "Strange Fruit".

                            producer Kanye West. It was released on February 14, 2016, through GOOD Music and distributed by
                            Def Jam Recordings. Recording sessions took place from 2013 to 2016, in Italy, Mexico, Canada,
                            and the United States. Production was handled by West and a variety of other producers,
                            including co-executive producers Rick Rubin and Noah Goldstein. West also enlisted guest vocals
                            for the album, including Chance the Rapper, Kid Cudi, Desiigner, Rihanna, The Weeknd, Ty Dolla
                            Sign, Post Malone, Kendrick Lamar, Sia, Vic Mensa, Chris Brown and Young Thug.
    
                            The release of The Life of Pablo was preceded by several promotional singles, including the
                            tracks "Real Friends" and "No More Parties in LA". During the months before release, the title
                            and tracklist of the album went through several publicized changes. An early version of it was
                            premiered by West at Madison Square Garden on February 11, 2016, as part of his Yeezy Season 3
                            fashion show. After several additional sessions and alterations, the launch occurred exclusively
                            for streaming on Tidal three days later.

                            American rapper Kanye West. It was released on June 1, 2018, through GOOD Music and distributed
                            by Def Jam Recordings. Following controversy surrounding an interview with TMZ, West re-recorded
                            all the work on the album, with him completing it over the course of just two weeks at West Lake
                            Ranch in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
    
                            Guest vocals from PartyNextDoor, Ty Dolla Sign, Kid Cudi, Charlie Wilson, Jeremih, and 070
                            Shake, among others, are included on Ye. West produced it with Mike Dean, alongside numerous
                            others. Succeeding the release of Pusha T's Daytona, the album was the second of five
                            seven-track albums produced by West in what were referred to as the "Wyoming Sessions", which
                            were set to be released weekly. It preceded the release of West's collaborative album with Kid
                            Cudi, as Kids See Ghosts, titled Kids See Ghosts. The latter's release was succeeded by that of
                            Nas' Nasir, and Teyana Taylor's K.T.S.E..

                            Kanye West. It was released on October 25, 2019, through GOOD Music and distributed by Def Jam
                            Recordings. The album follows a Christian theme, with West describing it as "an expression of
                            the gospel." It features guest appearances from Clipse, Ty Dolla Sign, Kenny G, Fred Hammond,
                            Ant Clemons, and the Sunday Service Choir. Production is included from West, Benny Blanco,
                            BoogzDaBeast, Francis Starlite, Pi'erre Bourne, and Timbaland, among others.
    
                            West began recording the album in August 2018, originally announcing it as Yandhi. The album
                            missed two initial release dates in September and November 2018 under the original title, before
                            being delayed indefinitely. West had formed his gospel group the Sunday Service Choir in January
                            2019, performing gospel songs and covers of songs from West's discography. The song "Water" was
                            performed live prior to release by the group. In August 2019, Yandhi was reannounced as Jesus Is
                            King, but it missed two planned release dates for late September 2019 under the new title.
